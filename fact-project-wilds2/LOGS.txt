Goal: make the provided code work
- README.md is very clear en works, correct links and code alterations are provided
- Attribute error (metacg_rho) for algorithm CG, solution: comment line 23 in CG.py
- EOF error when running code, with all algorithms
Subgoal: testing all datasets
-> dataset: amazon
	- EOF error
-> dataset: civilcomments
	- EOF error, solution: num_workers=0 in dataset.py
	- seems to work with ERM
	(maybe also filename issues, but was resolved before this error could take place)
-> dataset: poverty
	- too big
-> dataset: waterbirds
	- issue with filenames, solution: change ':' in filename to '_'
	- seems to work with ERM
	- seems to work with CG
-> dataset: fmow
	- FileNotFound error: 'data\\fmow_v1.1\\rgb_metadata.csv'
-> dataset: camelyon17
	- seems to work with ERM
-> dataset: py150
	- UnicodeDecode error: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x8f in position 2403: character maps to <undefined>
-> dataset: colored mnist
